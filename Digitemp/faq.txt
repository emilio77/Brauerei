DigiTemp v2.4 Frequently Asked Questions
Copyright 2002 by Brian C. Lane <bcl@brianlane.com> www.brianlane.com

Q. Where Do I buy Parts?
   www.ibutton.com sells the DS9097U-009 for $10 as of this writing. Go
   to their online store and look for the Serial Port Adapter Section.
   Click on the 'Blue Dot and One Wire Connectivity'

   I order my temperature sensors directly from Dallas Semiconductor
   at 1-800-336-6933 (http://www.dalsemi.com/sales/credit_card.html)

   They also have the old style adapter that DigiTemp v1.4 uses available
   as part #DS9097 or DS9097E described as  passive adapters.

   DigiKey as all of the parts needed to build the passive adapter. See
   the HOWTO.TXT document for DigiKey part numbers.

!  DigiKey is now carrying temperature sensors on their website. Do a
   search for DS1820, DS1822, DS18B20 to find them.

Q. How do I connect it to the RJ-11 of the DS9097-U
   Take a look at the DS9097-U data sheet at
     http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/9097u.pdf
   Ground is the pin on the right and data is the pin on the left (using
   the two center pins of the RJ-11).
   Even with this information you will probably get it backwards the first
   time so make a temporary connecting the first time and confirm that 
   you have the correct polarity.

Q. How many can I connect?
   Read the Dallas Semiconductor Tech. Brief on the One Wire Network.
   http://www.dalsemi.com/techbriefs/tb1.html it covers everything you
   want to know and more. The limit comes down to wiring, how much you
   have and how good it is. Other than that you can connect as many as
   you need.

Q. How long can the wire be?
   Again, read the Tech. Brief above. This depends on the cable. Using
   better cable will allow you to extend the cable longer distances.

Q. I have glitches in my data, what do I do?
   The first step is to check all of your connections to make sure
   they are soldered or well connected.

   Next, is your cable decent quality? Cat-5 is the best, with twisted
   telephone cable coming in second.

   If you are still having problems you should try Using a Schottky
   diode across the cable's end. Connect the diode reverse-biased with
   the cathode (the stripe) on the data line and anode on the return. 

   I used a 1N5818 across my attic sensor -- before adding this I was
   getting multiple glitches per hour. Now I have seen 1 glitch in
   about 2 weeks. 

Q. What is the difference between the DS9097-U and the App. Note 74 type
   of adapter.
   The DS9097-U adapter uses a serial port to 1-wire conversion chip that
   makes talking to the 1-wire network easier. DigiTemp v2.x uses this
   type of adapter (the DS9097U-009 and -S09 both work fine).

   The old style of adapter (sometimes called passive or App. Note #74)
   used only diodes and resistors to convert the serial port voltages to
   the one-wire voltages. Dallas still sells adapters of this type, part
   number DS9097 and DS9097E that is built on this design. DigiTemp v1.x
   supports this type of adapter, and include a HOWTO document with
   instructions for building your own.

Q. Which 1-wire temperature sensors are supported?

   DS1820
   DS18S20
   DS18B20
   DS1822
   DS1920
   
Q. Are 1-Wire HUBs supported?

   Yes, DigiTemp v2.3 for Linux added HUB support, and v1.7 for Windows
   added HUB support to the windows branch of the project. HUB support
   is planned for DigiTemp v1.7 for Linux, as well as a tray icon version
   for Windows.
   DigiTemp v2.4 for Windows also includes HUB support.
   Sorry for all the different version numbers. I was planning on dropping
   passive adapter support after the DS9097U-009 came out, but there are
   enough people using them that I am planning on integrating passive and
   DS9097U-009 support into a single code tree in v3.0
   
Q. I am getting intermittent readings with CRC errors and 85C readings

   Check to make sure you have the +5v pin grounded if you are using 
   parasite power mode (ie. no +5v power applied). If this doesn't clear
   things up, try the suggestions for clearing up glitches in the data.

Q. How do I run digitemp from windows?

   You can run it from a DOS window, or you can create a shortcut for it.
   When you create the shortcut you can add the command line arguments
   to the command name.

   Be aware that this is under Win98. I have no experience with Win2K,
   Me, XP, NT, etc.
